# Iterators

Under construction

while

Sometimes you want to repeat an action in Ruby while a certain condition is true,
but you don't know how many times you'll have to repeat that action

until

The complement to the while loop is the until loop. It's sort of like a backward while:


The next keyword can be used to skip over certain steps in the loop.


 more useful iterator is the .each method, which can apply an expression to each element of an object, one at a time. 

 The variable name between | | can be anything you like: it's just a placeholder for each element of the object you're using .each on.
